## Motivation

> Why did I write this blog post?

All too frequently, students in our Intro to Native American Studies class have shared that their high school provided little, if any, background on the United States relationship with Native Americans. I've had the same experience in my K-12 education.

I think it's important to know things like the origins of our country. I also think it's important for **Hamilton** students to be aware of the history of the land that our college is built on. So, I wrote this blog post to combine my passions for web development with the ideas I've learned from this class!

## Who are Native Americans?

This sounds like a rhetorical question. But we've learned that the identity of Native American is ridden with stereotypes and misconceptions. For example, is Native American a racial group? If so, how much "Native American blood" do you need to be a Native American? Is it okay to use the word `Indian`, or should we say `Native American`?

### Blood Quantum

> American Indians aren't a racial group, but they are certainly racialized by the U.S. government.

One really intersting thing that I've heard Prof. Schermerhorn say was that there is no biological definition of an American Indian tribe. "Native American" is political and federally defined. We've learned about the concept of a blood quantum, which is the process of using a blood test to determine membership into a Native American tribe.

As the image shows, the issue with the blood quantum is that it eliminates a great deal of Native American people if tribes intermarry with different tribes or intermarry with other people of other races. With the blood quantum, we'd be excluding people who the Native American tribes themselves would include.

On the other side of the coin is the idea of the `Pretendian`. These are people who claim Native American heritage but aren't actually enrolled members of the tribe. These people reap the benefits of being Native American, from listing it on a job application or applying for federal benefits.

### Indians or Native Americans?

The term `Indian` is a famous mistake made by Columbus, when he landed in the New World believing that he was in India. The term `Native American` is a term that was popularized in the 1960s and 1970s by activists. More recently, people have been advocating for simply calling Native Americans, `Indigenous Peoples`. Which one to use? We've learned that either work. Federally recognized tribes do not take offense to being called `American Indian`, so you'll see that term thrown around in academia.

### Native Americans today

> Are all Native Americans living on reservations?

No! In fact, most Native Americans live in urban areas. This is a myth that I've personally believed in, further highlighting how mythicized Native Americans are in the U.S.

Through the blood quantum, we may get the myth that _"All the Real Indians Died Off"_ (Dunbar-Ortiz). But Native Americans are very much alive, highlighted by a count of 4.3 million Native Americans in the 2020 Census. Note that the following data is self-reported and susceptible to Pretendians, but it's a great starting point.

| **Year** | **Census Population Estimate of American Indians and Alaksa Natives** |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2020     | 4,269,559                                                             |
| 2021     | 4,279,772                                                             |
| 2022     | 4,382,234                                                             |

## Federal Indian Policy

America wants Native American land, so there's a history of policy that has been enacted to get to the America that we know today. Federal indian policy started with treaties, made by the U.S. Military, when Native tribes were a sizeable threat to the young United States. These treaties were clearly unfair, since the U.S. had the upper hand military-wise. However, after a while, the U.S. stopped making treaties and made legislation on behalf of the Native American nations.

I understand federal indian policy in two parts: the part where the U.S. created legislation to take more land and assimilate Native Americans, and the more recent policy that attempts to remediate the crimes of the past.

### Taking land

Here are the big events that I've noted in class:

-   **The Indian Removal Act.**
    Famously signed by President Andrew Jackson, this act led forced Native Americans to move to reservations west of the Mississippi River. This led to the trail of tears, which led to many Native American deaths.

-   **The Dawes General Allotment Act.**
    This act is the biggest land grab from the U.S. government. It divided up Native American land (west of the Mississippi River) into pieces of private property for individuals to farm. These pieces of land were assigned to Native Americans and over 90 million acres of land was sold at dirt-cheap rates to United States citizens.

-   **The Indian Reorganization Act.**
    This act was a response to the Dawes Act, and it allowed Native Americans to form their own governments. Deceptively, but this law was still a form of assimilation that allows the U.S. to better control Native Americans.

### Remediation

Here are other big policies that I've learned about that gave money to Native American tribes:

-   **Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.** This act allowed Native American tribes to open up casinos on their land, leading to certain tribes getting rich.

-   **Cobell Lawsuit.** The Cobell lawsuit was a lawsuit against the U.S. government for mismanaging Native American funds that was signed by President Obama. This lawsuit settled for 3.4 billion dollars to the affected Native Americans people.

-   **Indian Claims Commission.** The Indian Claims Commission was formed to allow tribes to sue the U.S. government for land that was taken from them. However, the U.S. settled these claims by giving the affected people money, rather than giving land back.

## Conclusion

I'm really glad that I've taken Intro to Native American Studies with Prof. Schermerhorn. I think this background will serve me really well when I think about politics or even ethics relating to Native Americans. Having a historical and also a contemporary understanding of the matters is useful for casual conversations and overall building my worldview.

Thanks for reading my blog post!
